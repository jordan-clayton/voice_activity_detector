# Lock the 'ort' dependency to exactly version 2.0.0-rc.10
# Reason:
# When specifying version = "2.0.0-rc.10" without the '=' sign,
# Cargo treats it as a caret requirement (^2.0.0-rc.10), which includes pre-release versions like rc.10.
# If a newer pre-release (e.g., 2.0.0-rc.11) exists, Cargo may auto-upgrade to it.
# However, future rc releases may introduce changes that cause this project to fail to compile.
# Using '=2.0.0-rc.10' ensures that Cargo installs exactly this version, avoiding unexpected breakage.

# Similarly, lock 'ort-sys' to the same exact version.
# This ensures consistency and prevents indirect upgrades that could lead to version mismatches or build issues.
